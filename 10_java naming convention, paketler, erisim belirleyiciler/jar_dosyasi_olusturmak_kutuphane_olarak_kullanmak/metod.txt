This tutorial allows you to archive a list of compiled classes residing under a particular package in the form of a JAR file.

Suppose you have 2 classes A.class & B.class which resides under com.programmer.gate. In order to export a JAR file out of these 2 classes without losing the package route, you must do the following:

Go the root folder of the package, in our case itâ€™s com.
Press shift and right-click, then open cmd.
Run this command: jar cvf test.jar .
The dot(.) used at the end of the above command informs the jar operation to package the classes starting from the current path.
After running the command, you will get a jar file called test.jar besides the com folder.
